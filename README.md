# coding-quiz


## Description

The reason behind making this project was to create an interactive coding quiz with a timer.

This project was built to test the user's knowledge of coding. 

I learn a lot during the creation process of this website. I learnt a lot about web-apis and JavaScript together. Using them both was hard at first but then made sense once I got the hang of things.

## Usage

Below is a description of how to use this website.
